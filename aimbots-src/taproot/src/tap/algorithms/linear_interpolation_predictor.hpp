/**
 * A class that allows you to linearly interpolate discrete measurements.
 * Useful for increasing the resolution of data measurements. For example,
 * if you receive input data at 10 ms intervals and are running a controller
 * ever 1 ms, you can use this class so that the data you receive won't be in
 * 10 ms steps, but rather will interpolate using past data to predict
 * the data until new data is received.
 *
 * Usecase example, pseudocode:
 *
 * \code
 * LinearInterpolationPredictor li;
 * while (true) {
 *     if (new value received) {
 *         li.update(value);
 *     }
 *     runcontroller(li.getInterpolated(tap::arch::clock::getTimeMilliseconds()));
 * }
 * \endcode
