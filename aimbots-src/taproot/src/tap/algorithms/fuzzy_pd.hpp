/**
 * Fuzzy PD controller. A controller that is built on top of the SmoothPid object.
 *
 * Fuzzy logic is used to adaptively change the proportional and derivative gains at runtime,
 * whereas they are hard-coded in the SmoothPid object. This allows the controller to adapt to more
 * complex situations (such as overcoming sticktion, varying loads, etc.). Aside from adaptively
 * changing the gains, this controller behaves the same was as the SmoothPid object.
 *
 * For more general information about fuzzy PID, refer to this paper:
 * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/937407. You can also find others online. For a more generic
 * look at fuzzy logic, you can refer to this paper:
 * https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=488475.
 *
 * @note While it is not explicitly disallowed, the integral gain is not intended to be used in this
 * implementation. The FuzzyPDRuleTable is used in this controller, which does not have any fuzzy
 * logic for the integral term.
