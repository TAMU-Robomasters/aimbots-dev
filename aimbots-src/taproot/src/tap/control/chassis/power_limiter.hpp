/**
 * A utility to limit the power consumption of a chassis system according to its live current draw
 * and available power buffer (from the referee system). Assumes the motors being used are M3508s
 * and that the referee system is connected via UART.
 *
 * This class currently requires the referee system connected via its default UART port
 * and an object that implements the current sensor interface (specified upon construction).
 * The following issues address improved versatility of this class:
 * - https://gitlab.com/aruw/controls/taproot/-/issues/45
 *
 * This class will report a fraction between [0, 1] that you should then multiply your motors by
 * after running a control loop and before sending to the motors.
 *
 * Here is an example of how to use this class. This example assumes you have `leftWheel` and
 * `rightWheel` `DjiMotor` objects declared as well as a `PowerLimiter` instance called
 * `powerLimiter`. It is assumed you call this function repeatedly at the same rate that you run
 * your chassis controller.
 *
 * ```
 * // ... run some chassis control algorithm ...
 *
 * float powerLimitFrac = powerLimiter.getPowerLimitRatio();
 * leftWheel.setDesiredOutput(powerLimitFrac * leftWheel.getOutputDesired());
 * rightWheel.setDesiredOutput(powerLimitFrac * rightWheel.getOutputDesired());
 * ```
 *
 * If the referee system is not connected (valid data has not recently arrived), this class
 * does nothing.
